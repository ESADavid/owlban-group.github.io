# Troubleshooting Instructions for GitHub Pages

If you are experiencing issues accessing your GitHub Pages site at `www.Owlbangroup.com`, please follow these steps to troubleshoot:

## Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/OwlbanGroup).
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages."
4. Ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled and that the source branch is set to the correct branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`).

## Step 2: Verify File Presence
1. Check that the `index.html` file is present in the root of the repository or in the specified branch for GitHub Pages.
2. Ensure that any other necessary files (CSS, JavaScript) are also included in the repository.

## Step 3: Check for CNAME Configuration
1. Verify that the `CNAME` file is correctly set up with the custom domain `www.Owlbangroup.com`.

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation
1. If you have made recent changes to the DNS settings, it may take some time for those changes to propagate. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours.

## Step 5: Test Access
1. After verifying the settings and files, try accessing the website again at `www.Owlbangroup.com`.
