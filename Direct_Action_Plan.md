# Direct Action Plan for Resolving GitHub Permission Issues

As the senior engineer for the Owlban Group, here are the direct actions you need to take to resolve the permission issues you are experiencing while trying to push changes to your GitHub repository:

## 1. Log into the Correct GitHub Account
- Ensure that you are logged into the GitHub account that has access to the `OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io` repository.

## 2. Check Repository Access
- Go to the repository on GitHub: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io).
- Verify that your account has been granted access as a collaborator or member of the organization.

## 3. Re-authenticate
- If prompted to complete authentication in your browser, follow the prompts to log in and authorize access to the repository.

## 4. Generate a Personal Access Token (if using HTTPS)
- If you are using HTTPS to push changes, generate a personal access token:
  1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
  2. Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens."
  3. Click "Generate new token" and select the scopes you need (e.g., repo).
  4. Copy the generated token and use it as your password when prompted during the push operation.

## 5. Push Changes Again
- After completing the above steps, try pushing your changes again using:
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```
