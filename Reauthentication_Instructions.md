# Reauthentication Instructions for GitHub Access

If you are encountering permission errors while trying to push changes to your GitHub repository, follow these steps to re-authenticate and resolve the issue:

## Step 1: Confirm Your GitHub Account
- Ensure that you are logged into the correct GitHub account that has access to the repository.
- If you have multiple accounts, make sure you are using the account that has permissions for the `OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io` repository.

## Step 2: Check Repository Permissions
- Go to the repository on GitHub: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io).
- Verify that your account has been granted access as a collaborator or member of the organization.

## Step 3: Re-authenticate
- If prompted to complete authentication in your browser, follow the prompts to log in and authorize access to the repository.

## Step 4: Use Personal Access Token (if using HTTPS)
- If you are using HTTPS to push changes, you may need to generate a personal access token:
  1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
  2. Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens."
  3. Click "Generate new token" and select the scopes you need (e.g., repo).
  4. Copy the generated token.

- When prompted for a password during the push operation, use the personal access token instead of your GitHub password.

After following these steps, try pushing your changes again. If you continue to experience issues, please reach out for further assistance.
