# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

To ensure that your GitHub Pages site is set up correctly, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Access Repository Settings
1. Go to your GitHub repository: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/OwlbanGroup).
2. Click on the "Settings" tab.

## Step 2: Navigate to Pages Settings
1. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages."
2. Check the "Source" section to ensure that it is set to the correct branch (usually `main` or `gh-pages`).
3. If it is not set, select the appropriate branch and click "Save."

## Step 3: Verify Site Status
1. After saving, check the "GitHub Pages" section to see if the site is published.
2. You should see a message indicating that your site is published at `https://www.Owlbangroup.com`.

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation
If you have just updated the DNS settings, it may take some time for the changes to propagate. This can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours.

## Step 5: Test the Site
Once the DNS has propagated, visit `https://www.Owlbangroup.com` to verify that your site is live.
