# Final Guidance for Resolving GitHub Permission Issues

To resolve the permission issues you are experiencing while trying to push changes to your GitHub repository, please follow these final steps:

## 1. Log into the Correct GitHub Account
- Ensure that you are logged into the GitHub account that has access to the `OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io` repository.

## 2. Check Repository Access
- Go to the repository on GitHub: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io).
- Verify that your account has been granted access as a collaborator or member of the organization.

## 3. Re-authenticate
- If prompted to complete authentication in your browser, follow the prompts to log in and authorize access to the repository.

## 4. Generate a Personal Access Token (if using HTTPS)
- If you are using HTTPS to push changes, generate a personal access token:
  1. Go to your GitHub account settings.
  2. Navigate to "Developer settings" > "Personal access tokens."
  3. Click "Generate new token" and select the scopes you need (e.g., repo).
  4. Copy the generated token and use it as your password when prompted during the push operation.

After following these steps, try pushing your changes again. If you continue to experience issues, please reach out for further assistance.
