# Troubleshooting GitHub Permission Issues

If you encounter a permission error while trying to push changes to your GitHub repository, follow these steps to resolve the issue:

## Step 1: Check Your GitHub Account
- Ensure that you are logged into the correct GitHub account that has access to the repository.
- If you have multiple GitHub accounts, make sure you are using the account that has permissions for the `OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io` repository.

## Step 2: Verify Repository Access
- Go to the repository on GitHub: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io).
- Check the repository settings to confirm that your account has the necessary permissions (e.g., collaborator access).

## Step 3: Update Git Credentials
- If you are using HTTPS to push changes, ensure that you have the correct credentials stored.
- You may need to update your Git credentials using the following command:
  ```bash
  git credential-manager reject https://github.com
  ```
- Then, try pushing again. You will be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password.

## Step 4: Use SSH Instead of HTTPS (Optional)
- If you continue to experience issues, consider switching to SSH for authentication:
  1. Generate an SSH key if you don't have one:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```
  2. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account.
  3. Change the remote URL to use SSH:
     ```bash
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OwlbanGroup/owlban-group.github.io.git
     ```

After following these steps, try pushing your changes again. If you still encounter issues, please reach out for further assistance.
