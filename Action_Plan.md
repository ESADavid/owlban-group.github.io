# Action Plan for GitHub Pages Setup

As your senior engineer, here is a clear action plan to ensure that your GitHub Pages site is set up correctly:

## 1. Verify GitHub Pages Settings
- Go to your GitHub repository: [OwlbanGroup](https://github.com/OwlbanGroup/OwlbanGroup).
- Click on the "Settings" tab.
- In the left sidebar, click on "Pages."
- Ensure that:
  - GitHub Pages is enabled.
  - The source branch is set to `main` or `gh-pages`.

## 2. Check File Presence
- Confirm that the following files are present in the root of the repository:
  - `index.html`
  - Any additional files (CSS, JavaScript) needed for your site.

## 3. Review CNAME Configuration
- Open the `CNAME` file and ensure it contains the correct custom domain: `www.Owlbangroup.com`.

## 4. Update DNS Settings
- Log in to your domain registrar's website.
- Navigate to the DNS management section.
- Ensure the following A records are set:
  - **Host:** @
    - **Points to:** 185.199.108.153
  - **Host:** @
    - **Points to:** 185.199.109.153
  - **Host:** @
    - **Points to:** 185.199.110.153
  - **Host:** @
    - **Points to:** 185.199.111.153
  - **Host:** www
    - **Points to:** 185.199.108.153
- If using a subdomain, ensure the CNAME record is set correctly.

## 5. Save Changes and Wait
- Save all changes in the DNS management section.
- Wait for DNS propagation, which can take from a few minutes to 48 hours.

## 6. Test Access
- After verifying all settings and waiting for DNS propagation, visit `www.Owlbangroup.com` to check if the site is live.
